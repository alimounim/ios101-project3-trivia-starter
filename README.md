# Project 3 - *Trivia*

Submitted by: **Ali Mounim Rajabi**

**Trivia** is an app that lets users test their knowledge through fun, multiple-choice questions. Each question shows a category, a prompt, and four possible answers. Players select an answer to see if they’re correct — the app gives instant color feedback (green for correct, red for wrong) and keeps track of their score until the game ends.
